This was a project for my highschool engineering class. During this project, we were supposed to demonstrate knowledge about simple circuits in any way the students chose. I decided to make an algorithm that was capable of solving simple circuits.

How To Use It

To use my program you have to use a spread sheet that lists the components of the circuit and how each component of the circuit connects to other components. The program then spits out a spreadsheet with the current and resistance through each element. This application only takes in circuits consisting of wires, voltage sources, current sources, and resistors.
